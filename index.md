I'm Kyanne! I love computers and I love the Internet. I'm teaching myself how to program so I can test the limits of computing and to help develop technology that keeps our Internet open, accessible, and uncensored.

I am a privacy advocate, an open source enthusiast, and a [wannabe hacker](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/wannabee.html). Apart from computers, I'm a fan of my dogs, watching horror movies, and reading.
